Expected: Node n1 with data value "n1", front is null, behind is null
Node: Node: n1 Data: n1 Front: null Behind: null
Expected: behind will be n2
Node: Node: n1 Data: n1 Front: null Behind: Node: n2
Expected: front will be n3
Node: Node: n1 Data: n1 Front: Node: n3 Behind: Node: n2
Expected: data will be n3
Node: Node: n3 Data: n3 Front: Node: n3 Behind: Node: n2
Expected: data will be equal to n3 but not to n2
n1 and n3 equal? true n1 and n3 equal? false
Expected: everything in n4 will be null because of empty constructor
Node: Node: null Data: null Front: null Behind: null
